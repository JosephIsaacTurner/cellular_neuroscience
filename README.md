# Advanced Cellular Neuroscience

This learning resource was created by Joseph Turner for the Cellular Neuroscience (Neuro 480) course at Brigham Young University. 

## Description 

This resource covers key concepts of cellular neuroscience, based on the lectures and course materials of Dr. Mike Brown. This is an advanced course, and assumes a basic understanding of neuroscience. The course is intended for undergraduate students majoring in neuroscience, biology, or a related field, as well as interested students from other disciplines. 

- **Learning Objectives**: A set of notes covering the key concepts of cellular neuroscience. I keep these as concise and minimal as possible, however they are complete enough to be used as a stand-alone resource.
- **Study Resources**: A set of resources to help students study for the course. These include a set of flashcards and a set of practice questions.
-**Practice Questions**: A set of practice questions to help students prepare for the course exams.
