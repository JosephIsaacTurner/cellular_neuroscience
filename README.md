# Advanced Cellular Neuroscience

This learning resource was created by Joseph Turner for the Cellular Neuroscience (Neuro 480) course at Brigham Young University. 

## Description 

This resource covers key concepts of cellular neuroscience, based on the lectures and course materials of Dr. Mike Brown. This is an advanced course, and assumes a basic understanding of neuroscience. The course is intended for undergraduate students majoring in neuroscience, biology, or a related field, as well as interested students from other disciplines. 

There are four modules, each covering a different overarching topic. 

## Module Structure
- **README.md:** Module overview and resource guide
- **Chapters:** A folder for each chapter included in the module
- **Presentation Figures:** Figures from the lecture slides, with some additional annotations and explanations. These are intended to be used as a study guide, and are not a substitute for the lecture slides.
- **Chapter Notes:** Notes for each chapter that answer the learning objectives. These notes are as concise and minimal as possible while still covering the learning objectives. I don't want to waste your time with unnecessary information, but I also don't want to leave out anything important.
- **Key Terms:** A list of key terms for each chapter. These terms are important to know for the exams.
- **Practice Questions:** A list of practice questions for each chapter. These questions are intended to help you study for the exams.
