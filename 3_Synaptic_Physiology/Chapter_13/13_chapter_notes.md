## Chapter 13: Blood-Brain Barrier and Cerebrospinal Fluid

1. Location, anatomy and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
    - Function: Stable environment for neurons, excluding toxins, wastes, neuroactive substances, but still providing glucose and other essential nutrients
    - Anatomy: Endothelial cells of capillaries are tightly packed, and have tight junctions that prevent paracellular diffusion. Pericytes and astrocytes also contribute to BBB.
    - Location: BBB is found in all capillaries in the brain, but not in capillaries in the rest of the body.
2. Pathways across the blood-brain barrier
    - Paracellular route: between cells, but tight junctions generally prevent this
    - Diffusion (lipophilic): diffuse across endothelial membranes
    - Carrier-mediated transport
        - Facilitated diffusion (Glut1, L, MCT1): down concentration gradient
        - Active efflux i.e. secondary active transport (A system): against concentration gradient, but with concentration gradient of Na+. Example: glycine
    - Receptor-mediated transcytosis: insulin, transferrin
3. Lipid solubility and blood-brain barrier permeability
    - Some lipid-soluble substances cannot cross BBB, because they are actively transported out of the brain, are bound to plasma proteins, or are too large to diffuse across endothelial membranes.
    - Some lipid-insoluble substances can cross BBB, because they are transported into the brain through protein-mediated transport mechanisms.
    - High permeability: Diazepam(valium), ethanol, nicotine, water, heroin
    - Mid permeability: Glucose, L-DOPA, Phenobarbital, phenytoin
    - Low permeability: Sodium, peniccilin, mannitol
4. Metabolic blood-brain barrier
    - L-DOPA is transported into the brain by LAT1, and is converted to dopamine by L-amino acid decarboxylase; dopamine cannot cross BBB.
    - Glucose is transported into the brain by GLUT1, and is phosphorylated by hexokinase to prevent it from leaving the cell.
5. Circumventricular organs
    - Do NOT hve blood brain barrier
    - Secretory: Pineal gland, median eminence (hypothalamic-anterior pituitary interface), posterior pituitary
    - Sensory: Area postrema (vomiting center), subfornical organ (hormonal sensor), organum vasculosum (hormonal/osmotic sensor). 
6. Functions of cerebrospinal fluid
    1. Buoy the brain
    2. Mechanical cushion
    3. Stabilize neuronal environment
7. Composition of CSF
    - 99% water, 1% solutes (no cells)
    - Similar to plasma, but way less protein
    - 35 mg/dl protein
    - 60 mg/dl glucose
    - 290 mOsm/L
    - pH = 7.33
8. CSF Production
    - Produced by choroid plexus, especially lateral ventricles
        - Ependymal cells (modified glia) secrete CSF
        - Anatomy of ependymal cells: apical surface has cilia, microvilli, and tight junctions; basolateral surface has many transporters, including Na+/K+ ATPase, Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter, and Na+/H+ exchanger
        - Choroidal capillaries are fenestrated, allowing for easy diffusion of solutes
9. CSF Circulation
    - 500 mL/day
    - 140 mL of CSF at any one time
    - 3x turnover per day
    - Lateral ventricles -> interventricular foramen -> third ventricle -> cerebral aqueduct -> fourth ventricle -> lateral apertures and median aperture -> subarachnoid space -> arachnoid granulations -> superior sagittal sinus and other dural sinuses -> internal jugular vein
10. CSF drainage into venous system:
    - Arachnoid granulations are invaginations of arachnoid mater into dural sinuses; they have their own tight junctions in the villia called arachnoid barrier
    - Located near superior sagittal sinus
    - It is drained via giant vacuoles that pass through arachnoid barrier and into dural sinus. 
11. Relationship between brain fluid compartments
    - BBB: Capillaries <-> Interstitial fluid (<->) Intracellular fluid
    - Blood-CSF barrier: Capillaries in choroid plexus <-> CSF
    - Arachnoid barrier: CSF <-> Dural sinuses
12. Causes and effects of vasogenic edema, cytotoxic edma, and hydrocephalus
    - Vasogenic edema: BBB is disrupted, allowing plasma proteins to leak into brain. This causes osmotic swelling of brain tissue.
    - Cytotoxic edema: BBB is intact, but cells are damaged, causing them to swell (usually Na/K+ pump is not working, so Na+ accumulates in cell, causing water to enter cell). Caused by ischemia or toxins.
    - Compressed ventricles, flattened gyri, narrow sulci, increased intracranial pressure, herniation
    - Hydrocephalus: increased CSF volume, increased intracranial pressure, enlarged ventricles, compressed brain tissue (flattened gyri/narrow sulci), herniation. Caused by increased CSF production, decreased CSF drainage, or obstruction of CSF flow.
