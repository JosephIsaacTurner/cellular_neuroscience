## Chapter 14: Cerebrovascular Physiology

1. Brain Circulation Stats:
    - Brain: 2% of body weight, but 15% of cardiac output
    - Gray matter requires 4 times more blood than white matter
    - 70% of blood to brain comes throuhg anterior circulation (internal and external carotid arteries)
    - 30% of blood to brain comes through posterior circulation (vertebral arteries, basilar artery, posterior cerebral arteries)
2. Blood supply systems and circle of willis:
    - Anterior: carotid systems
        - Internal carotid arteries (ICA) directly feed into circle of willis
    - Posterior: vertebral-basilar system
    - Circle of willis:
        - Supplied by anterior and posterior circulation
        - Anterior cerebral arteries (ACA)
        - Anterior communicating artery (ACoA)
        - Internal carotid arteries (ICA)
        - Middle cerebral arteries (MCA)
        - Posterior cerebral arteries (PCA)
        - Posterior communicating arteries (PCoA)
3. Anterior circulation territory:
    - Internal carotid arteries (ICA) bifurcates into anterior cerebral arteries (ACA) and middle cerebral arteries (MCA)
    - ACA supplies medial surface of frontal and parietal lobes (mohawk)
    - MCA supplies lateral surface of frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes (sideburns)
    - Anterior choroidal artery supplies basal ganglia, internal capsule, some of optic tract
4. Posterior circulation territory:
    - Vertebral artery -> basilar artery -> posterior cerebral arteries
    - Basilar artery supplies pons, cerebellum, and midbrain
    - Posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) supply occipital lobe, inferior temporal lobe, and medial temporal lobe (back and bottom of brain)
    - Superior cerebellar artery supplies superior cerebellum, pons, midbrain
    - Anterior inferior cerebellar supplies inferior cerebellum, pons
    - Posterior inferior cerebellary artery supplied inferior cerebellum, medulla
    - Anterior spinal artery supplies anterior spinal cord and medulla
    - Posterior spinal artery supplies posterior spinal cord and medulla
5. Path of venous return
    - Cerebral veins -> dural sinuses -> internal jugular veins
    - Cerebral veins drain into dural sinuses, which are invaginations of dura mater into the brain
    - Dural sinuses drain into internal jugular veins
    
6. Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow, and neurovascular coupling
    - Cerebral blood flow is tightly regulated to maintain constant blood flow despite changes in blood pressure
    - 750-1000 mL/min of blood flow to brain
    - Optimal MAP for brain is 60-150 mmHg
    - Brain arterioles dilate in response to decreased blood pressure, and constrict in response to increased blood pressure
    - Active neurons release vasoactive signals (local vasodilators-- CO2, H+, NO, Adenosine, Prostaglandins) that dilate arterioles and increase blood flow
    - Conditions of high CO2, low pH, high vasoactive signals cause local arterioles to dilate
    - Conditions of low CO2, high pH, and low vasoactivesignals cause local arterioles to constrict.
7. Causes and treatments of occlusive stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.
    - Occlusive: blockage of blood vessel (most common)
        - Atherosclerosis: plaque buildup in arteries
        - Thrombosis: blood clot forms in artery
        - Embolism: blood clot forms elsewhere and travels to brain
        - Treatment: TPA (tissue plasminogen activator) dissolves blood clots, must be given within 3 hours of stroke
        - Surgery to remove clot/widen vessel
        - Blood thinners (reduce clot formation)
    - Hemorrhagic: rupture of blood vessel
        - Hypertension, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), trauma
        - Surgery to repair blood vessel
        - Reduce blood pressure
8. Cellular mechanisms of death
    - Hypoperfusion: decreased blood flow to brain
    - Ischemia: decreased oxygen to brain
    - Anoxia: no oxygen to brain
    - Loss of oxidative phosphorylation
    - Loss of ATP
    - Loss of Na+/K+ ATPase
    - Loss of membrane potential, cells depolarize
    - Glutamate release
    - Glutamate excitotoxicity (feedback loop):
        - Calcium influx (Glutamate -> NMDAR -> Ca2+)
        - Calcium overload
        - Activation of proteases, lipases, endonucleases
        - Cytoskeletal breakdown
        - Osmotic swelling (cytotoxic edema)
        - Cell death
    - Death of nervous system
