## Chapter 11: Introduction to Plasticity

1. Description of hippocampal circuitry
    - Direct perforant path: entorhinal cortex -> dentate gyrus
    - Indirect perforant trisynaptic path: entorhinal cortex -> granule cell (mossy fiber) -> CA3 (schaffer collateral) -> CA1
2. Hippocampal slices
    - Hippocampal slices are used to study synaptic plasticity in vitro
    - They are made by cutting the hippocampus into 400 um slices
    - They are bathed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) that contains glucose, oxygen, and ions
    - They are kept at 30 degrees C
3. LTP description and induction at hippocampal synapses
    - After tetanic stimulation, there is a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength at Schaffer collateral
4. Mechanism of LTP in hippocampal synapses
    - Schaffer-CA1 synapse: Depends on NMDA, because if you use MK801 or APV, then LTP does not occur
    - Direct perforant synapse: Not exclusively NMDA, because some potentiation seen with APV, but even less with nitrendipine (L-type Ca2+ channel blocker)
    - Mossy fiber-CA3 synapse: Not very dependent on NMDA, because LTP quite similar with APV. PKA inhibitor (H89) blocks LTP, so PKA is involved.
5. Early and late LTP
    - Early LTP: 1-3 hours, involves post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, insertion of AMPA receptors).
    - Late LTP: 3-24 hours, involves gene transcription and protein synthesis. Has some latency so it is called late LTP
    - Test by blocking protein synthesis with anisomycin, compare with a control to see if it is late LTP
6. Molecular basis of LTP in Schaffer-CA1 synapse.
    - Early LTP: Ca+ current -> CAMKII, PKC, TyrosineK, NO Synthase
        - New AMPA insertion, AMPA phosphorylation, NMDA phosphorylation, retrograde signal to enhance NT release.
    - Late LTP: Ca+ current -> PKA, PKMzeta, MAPK
        - PKMzeta: like PKC, but more persistent (waiting in ribosome for translation signal)
        - PKA -> MAPK -> CREB -> gene transcription -> protein synthesis
        - New synapses, new receptors.
7. Correlation between hippocampal LTP and spatial memory
    - Rats in underwater maze with hidden platform are less able to find platform when NMDA receptors knocked out.
    - Rats in underwater maze are more able to find platform when expressing NR2B subunits (more Ca2+ permeable NMDA receptors)
8. LTD Induction in hippocampus
    - Low frequency stimulation (1 Hz) induces LTD
    - NMDA receptor activation is required
    - Protein phosphatase 2a (PP2A)
    - Ca2+ influx activates phosphatases, which dephosphorylate AMPA receptors, causing internalization of AMPA receptors.
9. Correlation between hipocampal LTD and sptial memory
    - Rats in underwater maze that have inhibited PP2A have less behavioral flexibility in learning the new location of platform
