1. Classification of NTs
    - Small NTs
        - Acetylcholine
        - Amines
            - Catcholamines (derived from tyrosine)
                - Dopamine
                - Norepenephrine
                - Epinephrine
            - Serotonin (derived from tryptophan)
            - Histamine (derived from histidine)
        - Amino Acids
            - Glutamate
            - GABA
            - Glycine
        - Purines
            - ATP
            - Adenosine
        - Non-Traditional
            - Nitric Oxide (NO)
            - Endocannabinoids
            - Derivatives of arachidonic acid
    - Peptide NTs
2. Role, Physiological Considerations, Synthesis, Packaging, Receptors, Reuptake of NTs
    - ACh:
        - Role: neuromuscular junction, autonomic nervous system, brain
        - Physiological Considerations: sleep/wakefulness, alzheimer's disease
        - ChAT (choline acetyltransferase) synthesizes ACh from choline and acetyl-CoA
        - VAChT (vesicular ACh transporter) loads ACh into vesicles
        - Receptors: nicotinic (ionotropic) and muscarinic (metabotropic)
        - AChE (acetylcholinesterase) degrades ACh in synaptic cleft
        - CHT (choline transporter) loads choline into cytosol
    - Amines
        - Catecholamines:
            - Dopamine: reward, movement, involved in parkinson's, schizophrenia, drug abuse
            - Norepinephrine: arousal, attention, mood, involved in depression, anxiety, pain perception
            - All use TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) to convert tyrosine to L-DOPA
            - All use Dopa decarboxylase to convert L-DOPA to dopamine
            - All use VMAT (vesicular monoamine transporter) to load dopamine into vesicles
            - Dopamine is converted to norepinephrine by DBH (dopamine beta hydroxylase)
            - Norepinephrine is converted to epinephrine by PNMT (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase)  
            - Receptors: Metabotropic (Alpha and Beta)     
            - Dopamine reuptake: DAT (dopamine transporter)
            - Others: Reuptake: NET (norepinephrine transporter)
            - All use MAO (monoamine oxidase) for degradation in cytosol
        - Serotonin: 
            - Role: arousal/sleep, aggression, pain perception, depression/anxiety
            - Synthesis: 
                1. Tryptophan -> 5-HTP (catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase)
                2. 5-HTP -> 5-HT (catalyzed by 5-HTP-decarboxylase)
            - Packaging: VMAT (vesicular monoamine transporter)
            - Receptors: Metabotropic (many)and ionotropic (5-HT3)
            - Reuptake: SERT (serotonin transporter)
            - Degradation: MAO (monoamine oxidase)
    - Glutamate
        - Role: excitatory NT in brain, learning/memory
        - Physiological considerations: Excitotoxicity, epilepsy, stroke
        - Glutamine is converted to glutamate by glutaminase
        - Glutamate is loaded into vesicles by VGLUT (vesicular glutamate transporter)
        - Receptors: ionotropic (AMPA, NMDA, Kainate) and metabotropic (mGluR)
        - Glutamate is reuptaken by GLT (glutamate transporter) in neurons and astrocytes
    - GABA
        - Role: inhibitory NT in brain, learning/memory
        - Physiological considerations: epilepsy, depressant drugs
        - Glutamate is converted to GABA by GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase)
        - GABA is loaded into vesicles by VGAT (vesicular GABA transporter)
        - Receptors: ionotropic (GABAa) and metabotropic (GABAb)
        - GABA is reuptaken by GAT (GABA transporter) in neurons and astrocytes
3. Peptide transmitters: Description and examples
    - 3-36 residues long (much larger than small NTs)
    - Opioid peptides, brain-gut peptides, pituitatary, miscellaneous
        - EG angiotensin II, vasopressin (ADH), Oxytocin, etc
4. Most neurons contain a single small NT and one or more peptide NTs. They can be co-released.
5. Neuropeptides: synthesis, transport, storage, release, and removal from cleft 
    - Prepropeptide -> Propeptide -> Peptide
    - Translation and modification in rough ER and golgi
    - Form large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) that can contain multiple peptide types
    - Transported to axon terminal by fast axonal transport
    - Dock deeper in axon terminal compared to small NTs
    - Removed from cleft by diffusion (slow) or peptidases.
