## Chapter 12: Synaptic Plasticity, Continued

1. Neuroanatomy of nociception pathway
    - C-fibers: slow pain and temperature, synapsing on projection neurons; 
    - glutamatergic synapse on AMPA receptors on projection neurons in dorsal horn of spinal cord (spinothalamic tract)
    - Also can use substance P if C-fiber
2. Cellular Mechanisms of Hyperalgesia
    - Hyperalgesia: increased sensitivity to pain, often after injury
    - Central sensitization: increased excitability of projection neurons in dorsal horn of spinal cord
    - Short-term potentiation from residual calcium
    - Repeated stimulation induces NMDA current in projection neurons, causing long-term potentiation (LTP) of pain pathway (CAMKII, TyrosineK,PKC, NO Synthase, and PKA)
    - Effects: Lower pain threshold, more spontaneous activity, larger nociceptive receptive fields
    - Cellular mechanisms:
        - Presynaptic: More NT storage and release
        - Ion channel changes mean more depolarization (inward current) in both pre and post synaptic neurons
        - Phosphorylation of AMPA and NMDA receptors changes threshold/activation/conductance kinetics
        - More AMPA receptors in post synaptic membrane
        - AMPAR subunit composition changes for more Ca2+ permeability
3. Induction of fear condition in rodents
    - Tone (CS) paired with foot shock (US)
    - Tone activates auditory pathway, and foot shock activates pain pathway
    - Both pathways converge on lateral amygdala
    - Lateral amygdala projects to central amygdala, which projects to hypothalamus and brainstem
    - Hypothalamus and brainstem control autonomic and behavioral responses to fear
4. Neural circuitry of fear conditioning in lateral amygdala
    - Tone and shock converge on neurons in lateral amygdala; If they are activated together, they can induce LTP (this involves backpropagating action potentials)
    - Then, tone alone can activate lateral amygdala neurons, which initiates fear response.
5. Cellular mechanisms of fear conditioning in lateral amygdala
    - Increased Ca2+ (NMDA current, mGluR current (PLC), and voltage-gated calcium channels)
    - 2nd messengers: CAMKII, PKC, TyrosineK, NO Synthase, PKA, PKMzeta, MAPK
    - Phosphorylation and insertion of AMPA receptors
    - Changes in gene transcription, new protein synthesis, larger/more synapses
6. Behavioral conditioning in eyeblink reflex
    - Tone (CS) paired with air puff (US)
    - Tone activates auditory pathway, and air puff activates pain pathway
    - Both pathways converge on cerebellum
    - Cerebellum projects to pontine nuclei, which projects to facial nucleus
    - Facial nucleus controls eyeblink reflex
7. Neural circuitry of purkinje cell loops
    - Loop circuits (input to deep cerebellar nuclei):
        - Main excitatory loop
        - Inhibitory cortical side loop
    - Pathways to purkinje cells:
        - Mossy fiber -> granule cell <-> parallel fiber -> purkinje cell
        - Climbing fiber -> purkinje cell
    - Local interneurons:
        - Golgi cells (inhibit granule cells)
        - Basket cells (inhibit purkinje cells)
        - Stellate cells (inhibit purkinje cells)
    
    In simple terms, inputs from the inferior olivary nucleus and other precerebellar cells activate the deep cerebellar nuclei, but they also inhibit the deep cerebellar nuclei via purkinje cells. 
    
    This is because they synapse both on the deep cerebellar nucleus AND (directly on purkinje cells OR indirectly via mossy fiber and parallel fiber tract (granule cells)). 
    
    The purkinje cells inhibit the deep cerebellar nuclei, which inhibits the inferior olivary nucleus. This is a negative feedback loop.
    
8. Electrical response of Purkinje cells:  
    - Note: Climbing fiber activation is MUCH stronger than parallel fiber activation.
    - The key to long-term depression is climbing fiber activation (from inferior olivary nucleus). All parallel fiber synapses on purkinje cell that are concurrently active will be depressed. This results in overall less activation of the purkinje, thereby disinhibition of the deep cerebellar nuclei. 
    - So, if parallel fibers are acive WITHOUT climbing fibers, then the purkinje cell will be activated, and the deep cerebellar nuclei will be inhibited.
    - If parallel fibers are active WITH climbing fibers, then the purkinje cell will be depressed, and the deep cerebellar nuclei will be disinhibited.
    - PF1 paired with CF will be depressed, but PF2 that is unpaired will not be depressed.
10. Cellular mechanisms of LTD in Cerebellum
    - Ca2+ rises
        - VGCC, mGluR
    - mGluR activation of PLC pathway (from parallel fiber synapses)
    - Activation of PKC (PLC pathway)
    - AMPA receptors are phosphorylated.. and internalized!
    - 2nd messengers: PKC, CaMKII, PKA, MAPK
    - Endocannabinoids: PLC -> 2-AG, which binds to CB1 receptors on presynaptic terminal, inhibiting glutamate release
11. Eyeblink Circuitry
    - Tone (CS) paired with air puff (US)
    - Tone activates auditory pathway, and air puff activates pain pathway
    - Both pathways converge on cerebellum
    - Cerebellum projects to pontine nuclei, which projects to facial nucleus
    - Facial nucleus controls eyeblink reflex
12. Neural circuitry of eyeblink conditioning
    - Tone and shock converge on neurons in lateral amygdala; If they are activated together, they can induce LTP (this involves backpropagating action potentials)
    - Then, tone alone can activate lateral amygdala neurons, which initiates fear response.
