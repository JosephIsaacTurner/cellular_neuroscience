## Chapter 9: Synaptic Transmission

1. Katz and Miledi Experiment: Ca2+ is required for synaptic transmission
    - When using TTX to block Na+ or TEA to block K+, depolarization still occurs at synaptic terminal; this means that synaptic transmission is not mediated by Na+ or K+ currents, but actually Ca2+ and neurotransmitter release.
    - After injecting Ca2+, amplitude of post synaptic potential increased
    - Injecting Ca2+ buffer prevents post synaptic potentials
2. Calyx of Held
    - Calyx of Held is a giant synapse in the MNTB (auditory system of mammals)
    - Using caged Ca2+ and UV light, they were able to release Ca2+ and measure the post synaptic potential
        - Presynaptic Ca2+ determined strength of synaptic transmission
3. Synaptic delay
    - Time between arrival of action potential and initiation of post synaptic potential
    - Synaptic delay is 0.5-1 ms
    - Most important is time required to open Ca2+ channels. 
    - Related to calcium influx, NT release, and NT binding to receptors
4. Presynaptic calcium microdomains
    - Ca2+ microdomains are small regions of high Ca2+ concentration near Ca2+ channels, and conveniently extremely close to vesicles, release sites, and postsynaptic receptors
5. Structure and types of votage-gated Ca2+ channels
    - 4 domains of 6 transmembrane segments each. S4 is voltage sensor, S5 and S6 form pore
    - L-type: High threshold, slow release, found in axon terminals but outside active zones
    - P/Q type: High threshold, fast NT release/inactivation, found in active zones
    - N type: High threshold, fast NT release/inactivation, found in active zones
6. Neurotransmitter co-transmission
    -  Co-transmission is when a neuron releases more than one type of neurotransmitter, usually a small-molecule NT and a peptide NT
    - Peptide vesicles are larger and found further back in axon terminal (not at active zone)
    - Peptides released by high frequency stimulation (high ca2+ concentration)
7. MEPPS
    - MEPPs are miniature end plate potentials, which are spontaneous, small depolarizations (release of a single vesicle) of the post synaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction
8. Katz and Castillo, Quantal NT Release
    - Found that MEPPs are quantal, meaning that their amplitudes are multiples of a single unit (the quantum)-- a single vesicle.
9. Structure of active zones
    - In neuromuscular junction
        - Many vesicles are docked at active zones, and multiple active zones per synapse
        - NT vesicles are clustered at active zones and docked in close proximity to Ca2+ channels and postsynaptic receptors.
    - In central nervous system:
        - Only one active zone per synapse
        - 10-20 vesicle docking/release sites, and chance of fusion low (5-10%). The chance can icnrease with potentiation
        - Active zones are less well defined (particle web/mesh), but still have a dense collection of vesicles and Ca2+ channels
        - Average of 1 vesicle released per action potential
10. Spontaneous vs Evoked Release
    - Spontaneous release: vesicles fuse with membrane without action potential, resulting in mEPSCs, MEPPs, or mIPSCs
    - Evoked release: vesicles fuse with membrane in response to action potential, resulting in regular EPSCs or IPSCs
    - In presence of TTX, only spontaneous release occurs, which tend to have smaller amplitudes
11. Membrane capacitance monitoring of presynaptic terminal
    - When vesicles fuse, they increase surface area of presynaptic membrane
    - This increase in surface area is measured by an increase in membrane capacitance
    - Membrane retrieval decreases membrane capacitance
    - Measured using patch clamp
12. The Fusion Pore
    - Vesicles are pulled into membrane by SNARE proteins and partially fuse to form a reversible fusion pore.
    - Can flicker open and closed, or can fully fuse with membrane.
13. Synaptic vesicle cycle
    1. NT uptake into vesicle
    2. Vesicle added to reserve pool
    3. Vesicle docks at active zone
    4. Priming of vesicle by SNARE proteins
    5. Vesicle fuses with membrane making a fusion pore
    6. Vesicle is retrieved
        - Reversible fusion pore
            - Kiss & run: vesicle opens and closes and then detaches
            - Kiss & stay: vesicle opens and closes but stays attached
        - Clathrin-mediated endocytosis
        - Bulk retrieval: membrane is retrieved without clathrin coat
    7. Vesicle is recycled or degraded
14. Role of synapsin and rab for storage/mobilization/trafficking vesicles
    - Synapsin: Tethers vesicles to cytoskeleton, preventing them from moving to active zone until phosphorylated (Ca2+ influx)
    - Rab3: GTPase that when GTP-bound, binds to vesicles and tethers them to acive zone; when GDP-bound, vesicles are released
    
15. SNARE model of vesicle fusion
    - Process overview:
        1. Vesicle docking (synaptobrevin on vesicle binds syntaxin and snap-25 on target membrane)
        2. SNARE Complex Formation: Syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin intertwine to form SNARE complex
        3. Synaptotagmin senses Ca2+, promoting vesicle fusion
        4. SNARE dissasembly: NSF with SNAP uses ATP to disassemble SNARE complex
    - Proteins involves:
    - v-SNAREs:
        - synaptobrevin (VAMP): membrane protein that interacts with t-SNAREs to form the SNARE complex
    - t-SNAREs:
        - syntaxin: transmembrane protein on the target membrane (e.g., presynaptic membrane) that helps anchor SNARE complexes, part of the SNARE complex
        - SNAP-25: protein associated with the target membrane, it forms a complex with syntaxin and v-SNAREs to facilitate vesicle docking and fusion.
    - Synaptotagmin: Ca2+ sensor; it triggers vesicle fusion in response to Ca2+ influx, binding to phospholipids and SNARE complexes. Found on vesicular membrane.
    - NSF: ATPase that disassembles SNARE complexes. 
    - SNAP: protein that helps NSF disassemble SNARE complexes
    - Munc-18: Binds syntaxin, regulates SNARE complex formation.
16. Tetanic stimulation effect on synaptic strength
    - Residual Ca2+ in presynaptic terminal can increase synaptic strength
    - Auto-receptor mediated autinhibition can decrease synaptic strength
    - Vesicle depletion or receptor desensitization can decrease synaptic strength
17. Paired pulse facilitation and depression:
    - Paired pulse facilitation: when two action potentials occur in rapid succession, the second EPSC is larger than the first
    - Paired pulse depression: when two action potentials occur in rapid succession, the second EPSC is smaller than the first
18. Axo-axonic modulation of NT release
    - A -> B, but C synapses ON A's axon terminal, augmenting release of NT from A. Can beinhibitory as well.
    - Common examples include serotonin facilitation, and GABA inhibition
