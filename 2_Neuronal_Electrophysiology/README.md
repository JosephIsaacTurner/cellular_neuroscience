# Module 2: Neuronal Electrophysiology

In Module 2, we dive deeper into neuronal electrophysiology. We explore action potential kinetics, the physiology at the neuromuscular junction, receptors and synaptic integration in the central nervous system, and second messenger systems. This provides a foundation for understanding neuronal signaling and communication. By the end of the module, you will have a grasp of key concepts in neuronal electrochemical processes.

## Concept Summary
- Action potentials involve changes in membrane permeability to Na+ and K+, causing a membrane depolarization followed by a repolarization
- This pattern of polarization is regenerative and travels down the length of the axon
- Afer one action potential is fired, there is a refractory period during which another action potential cannot be fired because of inactivation of Na+ channels
- Voltage clamping allows us to measure membrane current in response to changes in membrane potential
- Distribution of ion channels along the neuron control how the neuron responds to membrane polarization
- Different ion channels produce characteristic current-voltage relationships
- The neuromuscular junction is a specialized cholinergic synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber
- Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that are permeable to Na+ and K+, and are key to understanding the physiology of the neuromuscular junction
- Synapses in the central nervous system are far more complex than the neuromuscular junction
- CNS synapses have different receptor types, and can be excitatory or inhibitory
- metabotropic receptors modulate many neuronal functions, going beyond just membrane potential changes
- cAMP and cGMP pathways are activated by G-protein coupled receptors, and can modulate ion channel permeability
- Phospholipase C pathway is activated by G-protein coupled receptors
- Retrograde messengers, such as endocannabinoids and nitric oxide, can modulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release
