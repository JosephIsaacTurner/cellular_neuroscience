## Chapter 8: Second Messenger Systems

1. **Metabotropic receptor functions**
- Modulate many neuronal functions in addition to potential
- Slower but longer-lasting changes than ionotropic receptors
- Slow EPSPs through by closing M-type K+ channels
- Presynaptic modulation of NT release
- Postsynaptic modulation of ion channels
- Modulation in cell body: Changes in gene transcription, membrane potential, length constant, and threshold/excitability of channels
- Retrograde and transcellular signaling

2. **Conventional G-protein coupled receptors**
- 7 transmembrane domains
- G-protein: heterotrimeric, 3 subunits: alpha, beta, gamma
- Examples: Dopamine, alpha/beta adrenergic, histamine, serotonin (except 5-HT3), purine, muscarinic ACh

3. **Atypical G-protein coupled receptors**
- Have large venus fly-trap domains to bind NT
- Form obligatory dimers
- mGluR, GABAb

4. **G-protein function**
    1. NT binds receptor
    2. GDP is exchanged for GTP on alpha subunit
    3. G-protein separates into alpha and beta/gamma subunits
    4. Alpha subunit eventually hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and reassociates with beta/gamma subunits, returning to inactive state
- **Activated beta/gamma subunits can directly modulate ion channels, while alpha subunits can also modulate other effector proteins**

5. **cAMP and cGMP Pathway**
- Alpha subunit activates adenylyl cyclase (or guanylyl cyclase if cGMP)
- Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP
    - Guanylyl cyclase converts GTP to cGMP
- cAMP activates PKA (Inactivating regulatory subunit dissociates from catalytic subunit)
    - cGMP activates PKG (clamshell unfolds to become active)
- PKA phosphorylates proteins, including ion channels
- Phoshodiesterase degrades cAMP and cGMP to AMP
- cGMP in sensory transduction for vision 
- cAMP in olfaction

6. **Phospholipase C Pathway**
    1. Alpha subunit activates phospholipase C
    2. Phospholipase C converts PIP2 to IP3 and DAG
    3. IP3 binds IP3 receptor on ER, causing Ca2+ release and activating calmodulin
    4. DAG activates PKC

7. **Phospholipase A2 Pathway**
    1. Alpha subunit activates phospholipase A2
    2. Phospholipase A2 converts phospholipids to arachidonic acid
    3. Arachidonic acid is converted to many possible lipid-soluble signaling molecules

8. **Endocannabinoids**
- 2-AG and Andamide are produced by phospholipase systems
- **Retrograde signaling:** diffuse from postsynaptic neuron to presynaptic neuron and bind GPCRs (CB1) to inhibit NT release

9. **Nitric Oxide**
- Produced by nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)
- Easily crosses membranes
- Activates guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP

10. **Receptor Tyrosine Kinases**
- RTKs are activated by growth factors and neurotrophins
- Promote cell growth, differentiation, survival, and plasticity
