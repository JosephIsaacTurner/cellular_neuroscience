## Chapter 7: Synaptic Integration in the Central Nervous System

1. **Differences between neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and CNS synapses**
- **Inputs**: NMJ receives one input, CNS synapses receive hundreds to thousands of inputs
- **Modality of input**: NMJ receives excitatory input, CNS synapses receive excitatory and inhibitory input
- **Transmitters**: NMJ uses ACh, CNS synapses use many
- **Vesicles**: NMJ releases ~200 vesicles per AP, CNS synapses release ~1 vesicle per AP
- **Synaptic Potentials**: NMJ produces large EPPs, CNS synapses produce small EPSPs and IPSPs that must summate to produce an AP

2. **Receptor Types**
- **Ionotropic**: ligand-gated ion channels
- **Metabotropic**: G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)

3. **Potentials vs. Currents**
- **EPSP:** excitatory post-synaptic potential
- **EPSC:** excitatory post-synaptic current
- **IPSP:** inhibitory post-synaptic potential
- **IPSC:** inhibitory post-synaptic current

4. **Excitatory Ionotropic Receptors**
- **Na+ and K+ permeable**:
    - nAChR (depends on subunit composition)
    - AMPA (glutamate-- depends on type)
    - Kainate (glutamate)
    - 5-HT3
- **Na+, K+, and Ca2+ permeable**:
    - NMDA (glutamate)
    - Some AMPA (glutamate)
    - Some nAChR

5. **Glutamatergic Receptors**
- **Receptor Types**
    - *Ionotropic*: NMDA, AMPA, Kainate
    - *Metabotropic*: mGluR
- **Receptor Location**
    - NMDA/AMPA/Kainate: post-synaptic
        - Anchored by PSD-95
    - mGluR: perisynaptic
        - Anchored by Homer
- **Ionotropic receptor structure**
    - 4 subunits
    - 4 membrane-soluble domains, (M1, M2, M3, M4)
        - M2 forms the pore and is not fully transmembrane
        - M3 is the gate that opens and closes
    - Extracellular N-terminal domain
    - Extracellular ligand-binding domain (binds NT)
    - Intracellular C-terminal domain (binds scaffolding proteins)
- **Conformational Changes: Activation and Desensitization**
    - Closed: M3 helices close off entire pore because clamshell domain is open
    - Open: M3 helices move apart to open pore because clamshell closes around NT, pulling M3 helices apart
    - Desensitized: M3 helices stay closed despite NT binding, becaue clamshells sag downwards and pull M3 helices closed
- **NMDA Receptors**
    - **Agonists**: glutamate, NMDA
    - **Required Co-agonist**: glycine or D-serine
    - **Antagonists**: APV, MK801, PCP, and Zinc
    - **Voltage-dependent block by Mg2+**: Mg2+ blocks pore until depolarized to -40 mV
    - **Permeable to Na+, K+, and Ca2+**
    - **Coincidence detector**: requires both glutamate and depolarization to open
    - **Involvement in LTP**: Ca2+ influx activates signaling cascade for LTP
    - **Silent Synapses**: Glutamatergic synapses with only NMDA receptors
    - **Health Implications**:
        - **Schizophrenia**: NMDA antagonists cause schizophrenia-like symptoms
        - **Stroke**: NMDA receptors are overactivated by glutamate released from dying cells (glutmate excitotoxicity)
        - **Alzheimer's**: Memantine, an NMDA antagonist, is used to treat Alzheimer's
6. **Inhibitory Ionotropic Receptors**
- **Cl- permeable**:
    - Reversal potential: -65 mV
        - So, it doesn't hyperpolarize beyond resting membrane potential
    - GABAa
    - Glycine
    - **Structure**:
        - 5 subunits
        - 4 transmembrane domains per subunit
- **GABAb Receptor**:
    - Metabotropic G-protein coupled receptor
    - Opens K+ channels (hyperpolarization up to -90 mV)
- **Health Implications of GABAa**:
    - Modulators: Benzodiazipines, Barbituates, Ethanol
    - Agonists used to treat epilepsy, anxiety, sleep disorders
    - *During development*: Initially excitatory, then becomes inhibitory
7. **Synapse Location and Function**
- **Dendritic Spines**
   - Excitatory synapses are on dendritic spines
- **Shaft Synapses**
   - Inhibitory synapses are on dendritic shafts
- **Somatic Synapses**
   - Inhibitory synapses are on soma
- **Axo-axonic Synapses**
   - Modulate NT release
- Location of synapse determine function, because of the distance from the axon hillock
8. **Summation**
- **Temporal Summation**
    - Multiple inputs from one synapse
    - Inputs must be close in time
    - Tau: time constant of decay (longer tau means more summation, longer decay)
- **Spatial Summation**
    - Multiple inputs from multiple synapses
    - Inputs must be close in space
    - Input strength depends on distance from axon hillock
    - Lambda: length constant of decay (longer lambda means more summation, more distance)
- **Shunting Inhibition**: Inhibitory synapse on dendrite shunts EPSPs by hyperpolarizing the membrane
9. **Action Potential Initiation**
- Hillock has very high density of Na+ channels
- So, starts a positive, regenerative feedback loop along length of axon
