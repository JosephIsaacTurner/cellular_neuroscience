## Chapter 6: Neuromuscular Junction Physiology

**1. Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ) Anatomy**
- **Axon terminal**
    - Active zones: presynaptic membrane that closely clusters Ca2+ channels and synaptic vesicles
- **Synaptic cleft**
    - Basal lamina: ECM that contains laminin, agrin, and cholinesterase
    - Schwann cell: wraps around synapse to nurture and insulate it
- **Motor end plate**
    - Junctional folds: increase surface area of post-synaptic membrane
    - nACh receptors: clustered in junctional folds adjacent to active zones

**2. End-plate potential (EPP)**
- Involves inward current into postsynaptic muscle cell
    - nACh receptors are ACh-gated mixed cation channels (Na+ and K+ in muscle)
- EPP is a graded potential
    - Decays with distance from synapse

**3. IV Plots**
- **Patch clamp recording of ion channels**
    - Current is plotted against membrane potential (voltage)
    - Point where no net current is flowing is the reversal potential (Nernst potential)
        - For Na+, it is +60 mV
        - For K+, it is -90 mV
        - But, for nACh receptors, it is 0 mV
        - Because Vm is -65 mV, then opening nACh receptors will depolarize the cell
    - This proves that nACh receptors are mixed cation channels (and the driving force for Na+ is greater than for K+)
- **Confirm selectivity of a channel**
    - By changing extracellular ion concentration
    - For example, if you increase extracellular Na+, then the reversal potential will increase (rightward shift)
    - If you increase extracellular K+, then the reversal potential will decrease (leftward shift)

- **Single-Channel Conductance**
- Conductance (g) is the inverse of resistance
- Conductance is the slope of the IV plot

**4. Muscular nACh Receptors**
- Five subunits
- Subunit composition: 2 alpha, 1 beta, 1 delta, 1 gamma/epsilon
    - Gamma is fetal, epsilon is adult
    - Fetal gamma subunits open for longer (during early development)
- Two ACh molecules needed to bind to open one channel
- Permeable to Na+ and K+
- Blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin

**5. Neuronal nACh Receptors**
- Five subunits
- Homomeric or heteromeric
- a7: Permeable to Na+/K+/Ca2+, blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin
- a4b2: Permeable to Na+/K+, NOT blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin
- Involved in modulation of synaptic transmission, especially glutamate synapses
    - ACh _receptors_ can be found on presynaptic terminals, and can modulate release of glutamate

**6. Ligand-gated channel desensitization**
- nAChRs can be closed, open, or desensitized
- Desensitization is a conformational change that makes the channel non-conductive even when ACh is bound
- Subunit composition affects desensitization
    - a7 receptors desensitize quickly
    - a4b2 receptors desensitize slowly
- It can take a few seconds to a minute to fully recover from desensitization
- **Factors influencing recovery:**
    - PKC: phosphorylates nAChR, causing it to recover more quickly
    - PKA: phosphorylates nAChR, causing it to recover more quickly
    - Calcinuerin: dephosphorylates nAChR, causing it to recover more slowly
