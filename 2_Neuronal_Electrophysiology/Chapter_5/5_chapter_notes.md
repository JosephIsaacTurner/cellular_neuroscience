## Chapter 5: Action Potential Propagation

**1. Action potentials**
- **Threshold:** -55 mV membrane potential that initiates action potential  
- **All-or-nothing:** Once threshold reached, action potential amplitude is the same
- **Self-regenerative:** Once initiated, action potential self-propagates along axon length without further stimulation via saltatory conduction
- **Refractory period:** Time after initiation during which new action potential cannot be initiated
    - **Absolute:** Period where new action potential is impossible
    - **Relative:** Period where new action potential possible with stronger stimulus

**2. Voltage clamping**
- Technique that allows experimenter to control membrane potential and measure changes to membrane current
- **Voltage clamp circuit:** 
    - **Internal Electrode**: Measures membrane potential
    - **Feedback circuit:** Compares membrane potential to desired membrane potential and adjusts current injected by voltage clamp amplifier to maintain constant membrane potential
    - **Current Electrode:** Injects current into cell to maintain constant membrane potential. The amount of current injected is equal and opposite to membrane current, so membrane current can be measured
- **Patch Clamp:** Technique that allows experimenter to measure membrane current from a single ion channel
    - **Cell-attached:** Patch pipette attached to cell membrane
    - **Whole-cell:** Patch pipette ruptures cell membrane, allowing access to cell interior

**3. Hodgkin-Huxley model**
- Action potential characterized by inward current (depolarizing) followed by outward current (repolarizing)
- **TEA:** Blocks outward repolarizing current by blocking K+ channels
- **TTX:** Blocks depolarizing current by blocking Na+ channels
- **Conclusion:** Action potential phases involve changes in membrane permeability to Na+ and K+

**4. Na+ and K+ current dynamics**
- Na+ conductance increases rapidly when membrane potential depolarizes past threshold
- Na+ channels are inactivated by depolarization, so Na+ conductance decreases rapidly
- K+ conductance increases more slowly when membrane potential depolarizes
- K+ channels are not inactivated by depolarization, so K+ conductance remains high during later phases of action potential

**5. Phases of Action Potential**
- **Rising phase:** Na+ channels open, Na+ flows into cell, membrane potential depolarizes
- **Falling phase:** Na+ channels close, K+ channels open, K+ flows out of cell, membrane potential repolarizes
- **Undershoot:** K+ channels remain open, K+ continues to flow out of cell, membrane potential hyperpolarizes
- **Refractory period:** Na+ channels inactivated, K+ channels remain open, membrane potential cannot be depolarized

**6. Voltage-gated channel overview**
- Note: There are many different subtypes of voltage-gated channels with different kinetics for each ion. These are just generalizations.
- **Na+ channels:** 
    - 4 domains, each with 6 transmembrane segments
    - S4 segment contains positively charged amino acids (voltage sensor)
    - S5 and S6 segments form pore
    - Inactivation gate (generally inactivating)
    - Blocked by TTX
- **Ca2+ channels:** 
    - Same structure as Na+ voltage-gated channels
    - Can be inactivating or non-inactivating
    - Blocked by calcium chelators
- **K+ channels:** 
    - 4 subunits, each with 6 transmembrane segments
    - S4 segment is voltage sensor
    - Generally non-inactivating (some exceptions)
    - Blocked by TEA
