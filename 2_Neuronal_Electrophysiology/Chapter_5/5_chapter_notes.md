## Chapter 5: Action Potential Propagation

**1. Action potentials**
- **Threshold:** -55 mV membrane potential that initiates action potential  
- **All-or-nothing:** Once threshold reached, action potential amplitude is the same
- **Self-regenerative:** Once initiated, action potential self-propagates along axon length without further stimulation via saltatory conduction
- **Refractory period:** Time after initiation during which new action potential cannot be initiated
    - **Absolute:** Period where new action potential is impossible
    - **Relative:** Period where new action potential possible with stronger stimulus

**2. Voltage clamping**
- Technique that allows experimenter to control membrane potential and measure changes to membrane current
- **Voltage clamp circuit:** 
    - **Internal Electrode**: Measures membrane potential
    - **Feedback circuit:** Compares membrane potential to desired membrane potential and adjusts current injected by voltage clamp amplifier to maintain constant membrane potential
    - **Current Electrode:** Injects current into cell to maintain constant membrane potential. The amount of current injected is equal and opposite to membrane current, so membrane current can be measured
- **Patch Clamp:** Technique that allows experimenter to measure membrane current from a single ion channel

**3. Hodgkin-Huxley model**
- Model of action potential generation and propagation in squid giant axon
- **Rising phase:** Na+ channels open, Na+ flows into cell, membrane potential depolarizes
- **Falling phase:** Na+ channels close, K+ channels open, K+ flows out of cell, membrane potential repolarizes
- **Undershoot:** K+ channels remain open, K+ continues to flow out of cell, membrane potential hyperpolarizes
- **Refractory period:** Na+ channels inactivated, K+ channels remain open, membrane potential cannot be depolarized
