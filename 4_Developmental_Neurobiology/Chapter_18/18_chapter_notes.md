## Chapter 18: Synapse Formation and Elimination

1. Overview of synaptogenesis at NMJ
    - Before contact, axons and muscle cells have intrinsic abilities, such as ability to release synaptic vesicles, NMJ membrane already has ACh receptors distributed relatively uniformly
    - At first contact, a rudimentary synapse forms and ePSCs are detected and get stronger and stronger in first few minutes
    - After contact, synapse matures and becomes more complex
        - Synaptic vesicles cluster at active zone
        - ACh receptors cluster at postsynaptic membrane
        - Synaptic cleft forms with junctional folds
        - Schwann cells wrap around synapse
        - Basal lamina (extracellular matrix) forms
        - Synapse becomes more efficient
    - ACh receptors are only clustered at NMJ, not distributed uniformly
2. Experiments about synaptic laminin + beta2 chain
    - Observation 1: after denervation but without eliminating muscle, synapse can regenerate very similarly to original synapse
    - Observation 2: After persistent denervation and muscle elimination, nerve still regenerate similarly in structure to original nerve without muscle
    - Observation 3: After persistent denervation and muscle elimination, muscle regrows and postsynaptic membrane is structurally similar to original postsynaptic membrane, even without nerve
    - Conclusion: synaptic basal lamina is important for synapse formation and maintenance
    - Beta2 chain: deposited specifically at NMJ by muscle cells
3. ACh receptor localization during synaptogenesis
    - AChR expression is upregulated at synaptic nuclei, and AChR are stabilized (longer half-life) at synapse
    - AChR expression is downregulated at extrasynaptic nuclei, and AChR are destabilized (shorter half-life) at extrasynaptic membrane
    - Signals from neuron cluster ACh receptors
        - Agrin
            - Agrin is released by motor neuron axon
            - Agrin in basal lamina activates MuSK by binding to Lrp4
            - Musk phosphorylates rapsyn, which clusters ACh receptors near active zone
    - Signals from neuron increase AChR expression
        - Neuregulin
            - Neuregulin is released by motor neuron axon
            - Binds erbB kinases, which ultimately increase AChR expression
    - Muscle electrical activity downregulates AChR expression at extrasynaptic nuclei
        - Electrical activity in muscle means that it already has a synapse, so it doesn't need to make more AChR at extrasynaptic membrane
        - After denervation, then, AChR expression is upregulated at extrasynaptic membrane, leading to fasciculations, twitches, and cramps
        - Electrical stimulating muscle can prevent fasciculations, twitches, and cramps by keeping AChR expression downregulated at extrasynaptic membrane
5. Synapse formation is more complex and difficult to study in CNS
    - 1/100th of size
    - Thousands of syanpses per neuron
    - Excitatory/inhibitory synapses with many NT types
    - No basal lamina between pre- and post-synaptic membranes
    - Much more plasticity
6. CNS synapse development
    - Gephyrin, PSD-95, homer, rapsyn
        - Gephyrin: Anchors glycine/GABA receptors to cytoskeleton
        - PSD-95: Anchors ionotropic glutamate receptors to cytoskeleton
        - Homer: Anchors metabotropic glutamate receptors to cytoskeleton
        - Rapsyn: may cluster receptors, but does cluster ACh receptors in NMJ
    - Neurexins (pre) and neuroligins (post)
        - Link pre- and post-synaptic membranes
        - Different isoforms match excitatory/inhibitory synapses
    - Protein scaffolds
        - Many proteins involved in organizing CNS synapse
    - Molecules secreted presynaptically: Cbln1 and C1ql
        - Cbln1: released into synaptic cleft, binds presynaptic neurexins to postsynaptic GluR delta2.
        - C1ql binds presynaptic neurexins to postsynaptic Kainate or metabotropic receptors
7. Key Events in Human Nervous System Development
    - Early: Neurogenesis (early gestation)
    - Next: Gliogenesis (late gestation)
    - Synaptogenesis (late gestation, early childhood)
    - Myelination (early childhood)
    - Synaptic pruning (late childhood, early adolescence)
    - Lots of variability in different brain areas
8. Synapse formation/elimination and pathology
    - ASD: Excessive synapses and overproduction dendritic spines, not enough synapse elimination
    - Schizophrenia: Too much synaptic pruning during adolescence
    - Alzheimer's: Failure of spine maintenance in late adulthood leading to synapse elimination
9. Role of astrocytes and microglia in synapse formation/elimination
    - Astrocytes: Promote synapse formation
    - Microglia: engulf synapses and promote synapse elimination
