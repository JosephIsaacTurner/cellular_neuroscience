## Chapter 15: Patterning the Nervous System

1. Fertilization to day 10:
    - First cleavage + elimination of polar bodies (day 0)
    - Morula (day 3-4)
    - Blastocyst (day 5-6)
        - Inner cell mass (embryoblast)
        - Trophoblast (placenta)
        - Balstocoel (cavity)
    - Implantation (day 7-10)
2. Gastrulation
    - Inner cell mass -> Bilaminar disc
        - Epiblast: primitive ectoderm
        - Hypoblast: primitive endoderm
    - Primitive streak: site of gastrulation
    - Epiblast cells fold inward to form endoderm, so now there are 3 germ layers
        - Ectoderm
        - Mesoderm
        - Endoderm
    - Ectoderm eventually forms the nervous system
3. Spemann-Mangold Organizer and Discovery
    - If you add organizer region to a newt embryo, it will form two fused nervous systems
4. Neural induction and neural plate formation
    - BMPs inhibit neural induction
    - Organizer region secretes noggin, chordin and follistatin to inhibit BMPs in the ectoderm
    - Portion of ectoderm becomes neural plate
    - Neural groove: depression in neural plate
    - Neural plate folds inward to form neural tube
        - Neural tube forms the CNS
    - Neural crest cells form at the border of the neural plate and ectoderm
        - Neural crest cells form the PNS
5. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are important for patterning the neural tbe
    - Shh is secreted by the notochord and floor plate
    - BMPs are secreted by the roof plate and ectoderm
6. Neural tube patterning
    - Shh induces ventral cell fates
        - Gradient influences gene expression
        - Motor neurons in ventral spinal cord
        - Mechanism:
            - Normally, patched inhibits smoothened
            - Normally, PKA and Slimb inhibit Gli/Ci through cleavage
            - Normally, cleaved Gli/Ci is a repressor for hedgehod-responsive genes
            - When Shh binds patched, smoothened is activated
            - Smoothened inhibits PKA and Slimb
            - Gli/Ci is not disinhibited (not cleaved), and it activates transcription of hedgehog-responsive genes
    - BMPs induce dorsal cell fates
        - Sensory interneurons in dorsal spinal cord
7. Embryonic development of brain
    - Neural tube closer: Folds and closes from rostral to caudal
    - Three-vesicle stage (4 weeks)
        1. Prosencephalon (forebrain)
        2. Mesencephalon (midbrain)
        3. Rhombencephalon (hindbrain)
    - Five-vesicle stage
        1. Telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres)
        2. Diencephalon (thalamus, hypothalamus)
        3. Mesencephalon (midbrain)
        4. Metencephalon (pons, cerebellum)
        5. Myelencephalon (medulla)
8. Rostral-caudal patterning of the neural tube
    - Wnt inhibitors induce rostral fates
    - Wnt induces caudal fates
    - Otx2 is expressed in the forebrain (rostral) (but not in the midbrain)
    - Gbx2 is expressed in hindbrain (caudal)
    - Engrailed is expressed in MHB (midbrain-hindbrain boundary)
    - Anterior neural ridge (ANR) is most rostral and expresses FGF in a gradient
        - FGF induces rostral fates
    - Zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI) is more caudal to ANR and expresses Shh
        - Shh induces caudal fates
    - MHB (isthmic organizer) is more caudal and expresses FGF
    - Notochord still expresses Shh (ventral/caudal)
9. Midbrain/hindbrain patterning of neuron types
    - FGF + Shh + Otx2 = dopaminergic neurons, in midbrain
    - FGF + Shh + Gbx2 = serotonergic neurons, in hindbrain
10. Rhombomeres and hox genes pattern the hindbrain
    - Rhombomeres are segments of the hindbrain
    - Hox genes are expressed in rhombomeres
    - Unique combinations of hox genes are expressed in each rhombomere
11. Anteroposterior patterning of forebrain
    - FGF8 is expressed by the ANR ()
    - Pax6 (tf) is expressed in gradient stronger near rostral end
        - Rostralizes 
    - Emx2 (tf) is expressed in gradient stronger near caudal end
        - Caudalizes
    - If you knock out Pax6, you get a caudalized forebrain (huge visual cortex), and vice versa (huge motor cortex)
    - This helps pattern and space the cortex into different sensory regions. 
        - Motor is most rostral
        - Sensory is caudal to motor
        - Auditory is caudal to sensory
        - Visual is most caudal
12. Afferent inputs contribute to cortical regionalization
    - If you transplant visual cortex to somatosensory cortex, it will become somatosensory cortex
    - If you ablate inferior colliculus, auditory cortex will be able to process visual information
