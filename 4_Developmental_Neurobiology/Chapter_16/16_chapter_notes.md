## Chapter 16: Differentiation and Surival of Nervous System Cells

1. In mammals, nervous system develops in stages
    1. Proliferation of progenitor cell population (symmetric division)
    2. Production of neurons from progenitors (asymmetric division, some symmetric)
        - Neurons are post-mitotic
    3. Production of glial cells from progenitors (asymmetric division, some symmetric)
        - Glial cells can divide into more glial cells, unlike neurons.
2. Stable tracers are used to determine cell lineage
    - Inject tracers into progenitor cells
    - Tracers are passed on to daughter cells
3. Notch-delta signaling
    - Hexagonal grid of progenitor cells is called proneural region
    - Notch is a receptor expressed on progenitor cells
    - Delta is a ligand expressed on progenitor cell membranes
    - When notch binds delta, it enhances split, which inhibits acheate-scute complex (AS-C)
    - Achaete-scute complex (AS-C) is a transcription factor that promotes neuronal differentiation and expression of delta
    - So, when notch binds delta, it inhibits AS-C, which inhibits neuronal differentiation and expression of delta
    - This creates positive feedback loop where a cell that expresses delta will differentiate into a neuron, and will inhibit its neighbors from expressing delta and differentiating into neurons (lateral inhibition)
    - Bound notch -> activates split -> inhibits Achaete-scute -> inhibits neuronal differentiation and expression of delta
4. Notch-delta signaling in mammals
    - Notch activates Hes, which inhibits Mash, which inhibits neuronal differentiation and expression of delta
    - Mash-1 is what promotes neuronal differentiation and expression of delta
    - High notch activatity means it will be a neuronal progenitor (proliferation)
    - Eventually, notch signal will decrease, and it will differentiate into a neuron (neurogenesis)
    - Also involved in gliogenesis, where high notch signaling develops astrocytes, and low notch signaling develops oligodendrocytes
5. 6 (six) zones for cerebral cortex development
    1. Ventricular zone (VZ)
        - Progenitor cells
        - Neurons migrate out of this zone
        - Largely disappears in mature brain or give rise to ependymal cells
    2. Subventricular zone (SVZ)
        - Progenitor cells
        - Neurons migrate out of this zone
        - Largely disappears in mature brain or give rise to ependymal cells
    3. Intermediate zone (IZ)
        - Neurons migrate through this zone
        - Becomes white matter
    4. Subplate
        - Neurons migrate to this zone
        - Eventually disappears in mature brain
    5. Cortical plate (CP)
        - Neurons migrate to this zone
        - Becomes layers 2-6 of cortex
    6. Marginal zone (MZ)
        - Becomes layer 1 of cortex
6. Neuronal migration
    - VZ and SVZ migrate radially to CP
        - Form cerebral cortex
        - Climb up radial glial cells
        - Form excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in cerebral cortex
        - Form inhibitory GABAergic purkinje cells in cerebellar cortex
    - Ganglionic eminences (GE) migrate tangentially to CP
        - Eventually form deep nuclei such as basal nuclei and amygdala
        - Form inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in cerebral cortex
        - Form excitatory Glutamatergic granule interneurons in cerebellar cortex
7. Location and behavior of the neural precursor cells
    1. Neuroepithelial cell
        - Line ventricles, expand and divide symmetrically across surface area of neural tube
    2. short neural precursors
        - Do not themselves attach to basal surface, usually divide symmetrically into two neurons
    3. radial glial cells
        - Divide assymetrically to produce more RGs and neurons, and indirectly form basal progenitors that divide symmetrically to produce neurons
        - RGs are the scaffolding for migrating neurons
        - Attach to basal surface
    4. intermediate progenitor cells
        - Divide to produce neurons (mostly symmetric division) 
        - Do not attach to basal surface nor apical surface
    5. outer radial glial cells.
        - Settle in outer subventricular zone, divide asymmetrically to self-renew and make neurons
        - Attach to basal surface, not apical surface
8. Mechanics of radial migration
    - Neurons migrate along radial glial cells
    - Involves microtubule dynamics, not actin
    - Once it reaches cortical plate, it detaches from radial glial cell and becomes a pyramidal neuron
    - Thus, cortex is built from inside out (inside-first outside-last)
9. Pathologies of Migration
    - Reelin mutant mice have inverted cortex
    - Doublecortin mutant mice don't migrate in organized fashion and form disorganized cortex
    - Lissencephaly: smooth brain, no gyri or sulci
    - Band heterotopia: band of neurons in white matter (two cortical bands)
    - Periventricular heterotopia: neurons in/near ventricles because they didn't migrate
10. Formation of neurons in PNS
    - Neural crest cells migrate to PNS
        - Actin motility, not microtubules!
    - Wnt: sensory neurons
    - BMP: autonomic neurons
    - GGF: Schwann cells
11. Synaptic targets pattern NT phenotype of PNS neurons
    - Naturally cholinergic while migrating
    - When they stop migrating, default for sympathetic postganglionic is adernergic
    - Sweat gland cells release IL6, which induces cholinergic phenotype
12. Viktor Hamburger survival experiments
    - Removal of developing limb bud: far fewer surviving motor neurons
    - Transplantation of extra limb bud: Extra motor neurons survive on that side
    - Significance: target-derived factors are important for survival of neurons
13. Neuronal Survival
    - Neurotrophins promote survival of neurons
    - Limited supply of neurotrophins from target, so neurons compete for them and only the strongest survive
    - Different neurotrophic factors are required for neuronal subtype survival
    - Neurotrophins that activate receptor tyrosine kinases, which promote survival by suppressing caspases that promote apoptosis
