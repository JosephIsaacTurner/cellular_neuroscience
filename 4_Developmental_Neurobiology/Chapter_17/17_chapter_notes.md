## Chapter 17: Growth and Guidance of Neurites

1. Steps as neuron in culture grows axon/dendrides
    1. Lamellipodia formation
    2. Neurite formation
    3. One neurite becomes axon
    4. Other neurites become dendrites
    - Role of par-family proteins in neurite differentiation:
        - Required for polarization of neuron into axon and dendrites
        - Without par, neuron will have multiple axons or no axons
        - Axon marker: Tau
        - Dendrite marker: Map2
2. Steps of dendrite development and maturation
    1. Initiation (filopodia/lamellipodia formation)
    2. Outgrowth
    3. Branching
    4. Spine formation
    5. Maturation (pruning)
    - Appears to be intrinsically generated!
3. Properties: Self-avoidance, tiling, and coexistence during dendrite development
    - Self-avoidance: dendrites from same neuron don't overlap (mediated by matching proto-cadherins)
    - Tiling: dendrites from different neurons of same class don't overlap (mediated by matching Hippo-TRC signaling)
    - Coexistence: dendrites from different neuronal types can overlap (non-matching Hippo/TRC isoforms and non-matching proto-cadherins)
4. Santiago Ramon y Cajal's contribution to developmental neuroscience
    - neuron doctrine: neurons are individual cells
    - neurons are polarized into dendrites and axons
5. Growth cone structure and motility
    - Actin-rich structures at tip of axon that guide axon growth
        - Lamellipodia: sheet-like protrusions
        - Filopodia: finger-like protrusions
    - Growth cone motility: actin polymerization at leading edge
    - Stabilizing and destabilizing cues attract or repel growth cone
6. Growth cone guidance mechanisms
    1. Extracellular matrix adhesion 
        - Mechanism: Integrins on growth cone bind to laminins in extracellular matrix, which can stabilize actin dynamics
        - Molecules: Laminins in extracellular matrix + integrins on growth cone
    2. Cell surface adhesion and fasciculation
        - Mechanism: Cadherins on growth cone bind to cadherins on other cells, which stabilize actin dynamics
        - Molecules: Cadherins on growth cone + cadherins on other cells
        - Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are also involved, which are expressed on other cells and growth cone
        - Fasciculation: growth cone follows other axons
    3. Contact inhibition
        - Mechanism: Growth cone repelled by contact with other cells that express ephrins
        - Molecules: Ephrins (on other cells) + Eph receptors (on growth cone)
    4. Chemoattraction
        - Mechanism: Netrin attracts growth cone
        - Molecules: Netrin (in environment) DCC (GC receptor) or UNC5 (GC receptor)
    5. Chemorepulsion
        - Mechanism: Semaphorin and slit in environment repels growth cones (destabilizes actin)
        - Semaphorin: repels GCs that express neuropilin or plexin
        - Slit: repels GCs that express Robo
7. Pioneer neurons are the first to extend axons, and express netrin to attract other axons, and cadherins to fasciculate
8. Axon guidance molecules can promote axon collateral formation, axon terminal branching
9. Pyramidal cell pathfinding
    - Pia matter expresses semaphorin which repels axon but may attract dendrites
    - Extracellular matrix in white matter expresses laminins, which attract axons
10. Retinal ganglion cell guidance
    - Decision to cross at optic chiasm:
        - Nasal retinal ganglion cells cross at optic chiasm
        - Nasal retinal ganglion cells do NOT express EphB1 (receptor for ephrinB2)
        - Temporal retina expresses EphB1
        - Radial glial cells at optic chiasm express ephrinB2, which repel temporal retinal ganglion cells which express EphB1, but do not repel nasal retinal ganglion cells which do not express EphB1, so they cross midline.
    - Decision on where to synapse in optic tectum:
        - Optic tectum express EphrinA, with more expression in the posterior tectum
        - Anterior RG cells synapse in posterior tectum
            - Anterior RG cells have lower expression of EphA receptors, so they keep going to posterior tectum
        - Posterior RG cells synapse in anterior tectum  
            - Posterior RG cells have higher expression of EphA receptors, so they stop in anterior tectum
11. Comissural sensory interneuron guidance in spinal cord
    - Comissural sensory interneurons cross midline from dorsal to ventral spinal cord in ventral comissure
    - Dorsal spinal cord expresses BMP, which repel the axon away from roof
    - Ventral spinal cord expresses netrin, which attracts the axon, which expresses DCC (netrin receptor)
    - Ventral spinal cord expresses slit, which repels the axon, which expresses Robo3 (slit receptor). This causes the axon to cross midline
    - Ventral spinal cord expresses Wnt, which causes the axon to turn rostrally and ascend spinal cord

## Interlude

1. The full story of BMP
    - BMPs initially inhibits neural induction until inhibited by noggin, chordin, and follistatin from organizer region
    - After neural induction, BMPs are secreted by the roof plate and ectoderm. They induce dorsal cell fates (sensory interneurons in dorsal spinal cord)
    - BMPs: signal differentiation of autonomic neurons in PNS
    - BMPs: Repel axons of sensory interneurons in spinal cord
2. The full story of Wnt
    - Wnt inhibitors induce rostral fates in neural tube
    - Wnt induces caudal fates in neural tube
    - Wnt signal differentiation of sensory interneurons in PNS
    - Wnt attracts sensory axons rostrally in spinal cord (guides them up spinal cord)
3. The full story of Shh
    - Shh induces ventral cell fates in neural tube (secreted by notochord and floor plate)
    - Binding Shh disinhibits Gli/Ci, which activates transcription of hedgehog-responsive genes
    - Also involved in patterning of brain
        - expressed by Notochord in hindbrain to induce caudal fates
        - Expressed by ZLI in forebrain to induce caudal fates within the forebrain
    - Involved in transmitter phenotype
        - FGF + Shh + Otx2 = dopaminergic neuron population, in caudal midbrain
        - FGF + Shh + Gbx2 = serotonergic neuron population, in rostral hindbrain
