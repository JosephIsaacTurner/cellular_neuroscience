# Module 4: Developmental Neurobiology

## Overview

This module covers the development of the nervous system. We learn how the nervous system is pattened in early embryonic development, how neurons find their targets, and how synapses are formed. We also learn about neurodegeneration and regeneration, and how the brain can repair itself after injury.

## Concept Summary

- The nervous system is derived from ectoderm

- First, the neural plate forms, then the neural tube, then the brain and spinal cord

- The nervous system is patterned by gradients of different morphogens and transcription factors along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes of the growing embryo

- Precursor cells in the neural tube differentiate into neuron types and glial types depending on presence or absence of signaling chemicals

- Precursors proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into neurons and glia

- After differentiation, neurons extend axons and dendrites to find their targets

- Axons are guided by a combination of attractive and repulsive cues in the environment

- Synapses are formed when axons and dendrites find their targets

- Specific receptors and adhesion molecules in synaptic membranes and extracellular matrix help guide synapse formation

- There are critical periods during development when experience is required for normal development

- Neurotrophic factors and presynaptic signals are required for survival of neurons

- Neurons in peripheral nervous system can regenerate after injury, mostly due to the presence of Schwann cells that are able to guide axon regrowth

- Neurons in the central nervous system do not regenerate after injury because of the presence of inhibitory molecules in the extracellular matrix and glial scars

- The brain is capable of reorganizing itself after injury, and can sometimes recover function even though neurons are very rarely regenerated
