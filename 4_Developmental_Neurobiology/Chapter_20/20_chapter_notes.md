## Chapter 20: Repairing the Damaged Brain

1. Wallerian degeneration: axon distal to injury degenerates
        - Related to axon transport, especially MNAT2
        - MNAT2 is a protein that is transported from cell body to axon terminal
        - It inhibits SARM1, which converts NAD to NAM
        - Without MNAT2, SARM1 is not inhibited, so NAD is converted to NAM, which means loss of NAD, which means axon degeneration
        - If you inhibit SARM1, then axon degeneration is inhibited
2. Chromatolysis: Degeneration of cell body after axon injury
    - Without axon, cell body doesn't get enough trophic factors
    - Leads to apoptosis
3. Anterograde transneuronal degeneration: degeneration of neurons that synapse with injured neurons, because of loss of input
4. Retrograde transneuronal degeneration: degeneration of neurons that synapse with injured neurons, because of loss of trophic factors
5. Synaptic stripping: loss of synapses from injured neurons
6. Effects of injury on glial cells
    - Glial cells will remove debris from injury and strip synapses from injured neurons
    - Reactive astroctyes: form glial scar to prevent further damage
    - Oligodendrocytes release inhibitory molecules that prevent axon regeneration
    - Schwann cells release neurotrophic factors, which promote axon regeneration
7. Why do axons in PNS regenerate better than axons in CNS?
    - Schwann cells release neurotrophic factors, which promote axon regeneration, unlike oligodendrocytes in CNS
    - Myelin sheath prevents axon from growign in wrong direction, and CAMs along schwann cell path promote growth
    - Oligodendrocytes release inhibitory molecules that prevent axon regeneration
    - Myelin debris in CNS inhibits axon regeneration, and reactive astrocytes form inhibitory glial scar
8. CNS axons are capable of regenerating in PNS environment
    - CNS axons will regenerate if PNS environment is provided by transplanting cut PNS tissue into CNS
    - PNS axons will not regenerate if CNS environment is provided by transplanting cut CNS tissue into PNS
9. Importance of growth/trophic factors in axon regeneration
    - Different growth factors are required for different types of neurons
    - CNS myelin and glial scars contain inhibitory molecules that prevent axon regeneration
10. Damaged oligodendrocytes and astrocytes make inhibitory molecules that inhibit growth cone
    - Oligodendrocytes
        - Nogo-A
        - MAG (myelin associated glycoprotein)
        - Omgp (oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein)
    - Reactive astrocytes 
        - CSPGs (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans)
11. Intrinsic nerve growth program
    - Signal cascades promote growth
        - Prior peripheral lesion promotes regeneration of CNS axons
        - Basically priming cell into a growth state to overcome inhibitory CNS environment
        - Increased cAMP and GAP-43 are involved to prime neuron to growth state
12. In CNS, there isn't enough growth factor signaling partially due to SOCS3 and PTEN
        - Block receptors for CNS growth factors
        - If you knock out SOCS3, then you get some regeneration
        - PTEN inhibits another pathway that would help growth, so blocking PTEN also aids in regeneration
        - Ideal: inhibit SOCS3 and PTEN, leads to enhanced regeneration
13. Circuit reorganization for functional recovery
    - After lesion in corticospinal tract, there is a loss of motor function
    - However, rubrospinal tract can take over some of the function through circuit reorganization
14. Neurons are regenerated in adult brain
    - Dendate gyrus in hippocampus
        - New granule cells generated throughout life
    - Subventricular zone
        - Migrates to olfactory bulb along astrocyte scaffold
        - Become olfactory bulb granule cells, and olfactory bulb periglomerular cells
15. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
    - Take skin cells, and add transcription factors to make them into stem cells, then differentiate them into neurons or whatever cell type we want
    - Cell transplantation in parkinson's disease
    - OPC (oligendrocyte precursors) transplantation in spinal cord injury for remyelination in M.S.
    - Useful as models for studying disease
