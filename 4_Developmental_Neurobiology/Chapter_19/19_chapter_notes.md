## Chapter 19: Experience and the Refinement of Synaptic Connections

1. Overview of patterning and refinement of synaptic connections
    - Initially established by axon pathfinding
        - Genetically determined through molecular programming/ cell-cell signaling
    - Refined by experience
        - Activity-dependent
        - Involves critical/sensitive periods
2. Overview of visual system circuitry
    - Retina (visual field decussation -> optic tract) -> LGN -> V1 (layer 4C) -> Layers 2/3
    - Layer 4C only receives monocular input
    - Layer 2/3 receives binocular input, but biased towards a specific eye
3. Experiments on visual system
    - Certain columns in V1 respond to certain orientations of lines, and specific direction of movement
    - Columns tend to respond preferentially to one eye (very few columns are equally responsive to both eyes)
    - After suturing eyes for 6 months, the columns are way less responsive to the sutured eye, and most are very responsive to the open eye
    - If you suture eye during critical period (months 3 - 6) then deprived eye will be permanently blind
    - If you suture eye after critical period (months 6 - 9) then deprived eye will have very little effect on cortical columns
    - If you suture eye during part of critical period or before critical period, then cortical columns will be less responsive to deprived eye, but it is not permanent
    - After six months of visual deprivation, then dominance columns for deprived eye are smaller and scrawny, and dominance columns for open eye are larger and more robust
    - Conclusion: Ocular column structure and function is experience-dependent during critical period
4. Hebb's Postulate
    - Competition between synapses for postsynaptic targets
    - Neurons that fire together wire together
5. Cellular mechanisms of postnatal synaptic refinement in visual system
    - Axon branching
    - Dendritic remodeling
    - Synaptic LTP/LTD
6. Regulation of critical period
    - GABA function
        - GABA system is excitatory in early development, but matures to be inhibitory
        - If you enhance GABA maturation, then critical period is earlier
        - If you delay GABA maturation, then critical period is later
    - Molecular brakes are activated to end critical period
        - Perineuronal nets: inhibitory ECM surrounding neurons
        - Myelin proteins
        - Lynx proteins block nAChRs
    - Some interventions may reopen critical period
7. Some brain regions/functions have different critical periods during development
    - Sensory pathways have early critical periods
    - Language, motor pathways have later critical periods
    - Higher cognitive functions like math have even later critical periods
    - In cats, critical period for orientation selectivity is earlier than critical period for ocular dominance
8. Plasticity in the adult brain
    - Ability to change decreases with age
    - Effort required to enact such changes increases with age
    - Plasticity in mature CNS still occurs, but is more limited
9. Importance of critical periods for society
    - Early intervention for developmental disorders affecting sensory pathways
    - Critical periods for emotional and social developmental
    - Early intervention for learning disabilities
    - Lifelong learning
