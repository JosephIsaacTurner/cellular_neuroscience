## Chapter 1: Nervous System Cells and Circuits

1. **Basic Neuron Anatomy**
- Dendrites (input- potentially thousands of dendrites per neuron)
- Soma (cell body)
- Axon hillock (location of AP initiation)
- Axon
- Axon terminal (output)

2. **Basic Neuron Types**
- **Sensory neurons**: receive input from sensory receptors. Generally have fewer inputs and outputs
- **Motor neurons**: receive input from other neurons and send output to muscles or glands. Generally have many inputs but fewer outputs
- **Interneurons**: receive input from other neurons and send output to other neurons. Generally have many inputs and outputs
    - Relay interneurons: receive input from one neuron and send output to another neuron (1:1 input:output)
    - Local interneurons: Involved in local circuist, reflxes, and processing

3. **Neuronal Signaling**
- Changes in electrical potential across the neuronal cell membrane
- Result of changes to membrane permeability to ions by opening and closing ion channels
- Depolarizing (excitatory) or hyperpolarizing (inhibitory)
- **Integration**: summing of inputs to determine whether to fire an action potential. 

4. **Action Potentials**
- Large, rapid depolarizations that travel down the axon to the axon terminal. 
- All-or-none
- Self propagating/regenerative
- Very fast (up to 100 m/s)

5. **Output**
- Neurotransmitters released into synaptic cleft at axon terminal
- Amount of NT released is proportional to frequency of APs arriving at axon terminal
- NTs bind to receptors on post-synaptic cell and cause changes in membrane potential

6. **Knee Jerk Reflex**
- Sensory neuron synapses directly onto extensor motor neuron
- Sensory neuron synapses onto inhibitory interneuron, which synapses onto flexor motor neuron and inhibits it

7. **Neuronal Circuits**
- **Divergence**: one neuron synapses onto many neurons
- **Convergence**: many neurons synapse onto one neuron
- **Feedforward**: one neuron synapses onto another neuron, which synapses onto another neuron
- **Feedback**: one neuron synapses onto another neuron, which synapses back onto the first neuron
- **Feedforward Inhibition**: one neuron synapses onto another neuron, which inhibits the next neuron in the chain
- **Disinhibition**: one neuron synapses onto another neuron, which inhibits an inhibitory neuron, which disinhibits the next neuron in the chain (this is super important to understand)
- **Lateral Inhibition**: one neuron synapses onto another neuron, but also inhibits the neurons on either side of it
