## Chapter 7: Cells of the Nervous System

**1. Dendritic arbors:** Receptive region of neurons that may be extensively branched and receive thousands of synaptic inputs.
- **Dendritic spines**: Small protrusions from dendrites that receive synaptic inputs.
- Have ribosomes and ER, and can synthesize proteins locally

**2. Axon Structure:** Long, thin processes that carry action potentials away from the cell body as output signals to other neurnos. 
- **Axon Collaterals:** Branches of axons that allow a single neuron to communicate with multiple other neurons.
- **Axon Terminal Arbor:** The complex of axon terminals at the end of an axon. May be extensively branched. 
- **Varicosities:** Enlargements along axon length that contain synaptic vesicles and serve as locations for synaptic transmission (synapse en passant), even though the axon has not yet reached its final target
- Do not have ribosomes or ER, and cannot synthesize proteins locally (requries anterograde transport from cell body)

**3. Microtubules:** 
- Run longitudinally down the axon and dendrites
- Tube of 13 protofilaments of alpha/beta tubulin dimers
- **Dynamic instability:** At plus end, the microtubule can grow or shrink rapidly, whereas at the minus end, it is more stable
- **MAPs:** Microtubule-associated proteins that stabilize microtubules and regulate their assembly/disassembly (MAP-2 in dendrites, Tau in axons)
- **Acetylation:** Strengthens microtubules and increases flexibility
- **Polarity:** Plus end is usually at axon terminal, minus end is usually at cell body; In dendrites however, there is mixed polarity
- **Function**: Structural support for neurites, and scaffold for intracellular transport

**4. Axonal Transport**
- **Anterograde Transport:** Movement of materials from the cell body to the axon terminal, powered by kinesin
- **Retrograde Transport:** Movement of materials from the axon terminal to the cell body, powered by dynein

**5. Microfilaments**
- **Composition:** Rope-like helices of f-actin
- **Treadmilling:** Actin monomers are added to the plus end and removed from the minus end
- **Cross-linking proteins:** Bundles of actin filaments are cross-linked by actin-binding proteins; increases strength and rigidity
- **Location:** Immediately beneath membranes throughout the neuron, especially in dendritic spines, axon terminals, and growing tips of neurites
- **Function:** Motility, growth of neurites, and structural support of membrane scaffolds
    - Filopodia and lamellipodia of growth cones are formed by actin polymerization

**6. Denritic Spine Development**
- Immature: filopodia
- Intermediate: thin, stubby
- Mature: Mushroom shaped, cup shaped

**7. Intermediate Filaments**
- **Composition:** Complex arrangement of coiled dimers
    - Neurofilaments: Neurons
    - Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP): Glia
- **Location:** Throught cell body and in _mature_ neurites
- **Function:** Structural support for neurites
- Very stable, no dynamic instability or treadmilling
- No polarity

**8. Cerebral Cortex**
- **Layers:** Six layers, numbered from superficial to deep
    - **Layer I:** Molecular layer
    - **Layer II:** External granular layer
    - **Layer III:** External pyramidal layer
    - **Layer IV:** Internal granular layer
    - **Layer V:** Internal pyramidal layer
    - **Layer VI:** Multiform layer
- **Cell types:**
    - **Projection:** Pyramidal cells: Excitatory, glutamatergic
    - **Local Interneurons:** Basket cells, chandelier cells, etc: Inhibitory, GABAergic

**9. Cerebellar Cortex**
- **Layers:** Three layers, numbered from superficial to deep
    - **Layer I:** Molecular layer
    - **Layer II:** Purkinje cell layer
    - **Layer III:** Granular layer
- **Cell types:**
    - **Projection:** Purkinje cells: Inhibitory, GABAergic
    - **Local Interneurons:** Basket cells, stellate cells, golgi cells: Inhibitory, GABAergic
    - **Granule cells:** Excitatory, glutamatergic, also considered local interneurons

**10. Neurons of PNS**
- **Primary sensory neurons:** Cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia, receive sensory information from peripheral receptors
- **Autonomic Nervous System Ganglionic Neurons:** Cell bodies in autonomic ganglia, receive information from CNS and innervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands

**11. Glial Cell Types**
- **Oligodendroctyes:** Myelinate axons in CNS
- **Schwann cells:** Myelinate axons in PNS
- **Astrocytes:** Regulate extracellular ion concentrations, take up neurotransmitters, and provide metabolic support to neurons in CNS
- **Microglia:** Immune cells of CNS, remove debris and dead cells

**12. Myelin**
- **Nodes of Ranvier:** Gaps in myelin sheath where axon is exposed to extracellular space (1-2 microns)
- **Internode:** Myelin-covered segment of axon between nodes of Ranvier (300-1500 microns)
- **Composition:** 70% lipid, 30% protein. Concentric bilayers of lipids with protein layers in between
- **Development:** Schwann cells wrap around axon multiple times, then squeeze out cytoplasm to form myelin sheath. Oligodendrocytes wrap around and myelinate multiple axons

**13. Myelin associated proteins**
- **PNS myelin proteins**: 
    - MBP (adheres cytosol to compact myelin)
    - P0 (links myelin layers)
    - Cx32 (connexin for gap junctions between myelin layers)
- **CNS myelin proteins:**
    - MBP (adheres cytosol to compact myelin)
    - PLP (spaces out myelin layers)

**14. Nodes of Ranvier Organization**
- Node (Na+ channels)
- Paranode (Caspr2)
- Juxtaparanode (K+ channels)

**15. Astrocytes**
- **Fibrous:** Reside in white matter, support nodes of ranvier
- **Protoplasmic:** Reside in gray matter, support synapses
- **Tripartite synapse:** Protoplasmic astrocyte processes contact presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic dendritic spine
- **Syncytia:** Astrocytes are coupled via gap junctions, allowing for rapid spread of Ca2+ waves, synchronizing activity of astrocyte networks and neurons

**16. Microglia**
- **Function:** Phagocytic immune cells of CNS, remove debris and dead cells, prune synapses

**17. Glia to Neuron Ratio 1.5:1 in human cortex; Including white matter, it is 3:1**
