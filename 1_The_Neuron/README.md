# Module 1: The Neuron

This module provides an introduction to key concepts in neuroscience that will be built upon throughout the course. We cover the fundamental anatomy and cell biology of neurons, the different cell types that make up the nervous system, a primer on ion channels, and the basic electrochemical properties that characterize a neuron at rest.

## Concept Summary

- Neurons receive input at the dendrites
- If the input is strong enough, the neuron will initiate an action potential at the axon hillock
- The action potential will propagate down the axon to the axon terminal and cause the release of neurotransmitter at the synapse
- The neurotransmitter will bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell (neuron or muscle) and cause a change in its membrane potential
- Signals can be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing)
- The nervous system is composed of neurons and glia
- The central nervous system (CNS) is different from the peripheral nervous system (PNS) both in terms of cell types, subcellular composition, and function
- The cytoskeleton is composed of microtubules, neurofilaments, and microfilaments
- The cytoskeleton is highly dynamic and can be remodeled to change the shape of the neuron and develop and maintain synapses
- Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that allow ions to flow down their concentration gradients
- They can be gated by voltage, ligands, or mechanical forces
- Ion channels are selective for specific ions
- The molecular structure of the channel determines its properties
- The permeability of the neuronal membrane to different ions determines the resting membrane potential
- The neuron can be modeled as a circuit with voltage sources (ion concentration gradients), current sources (ion pumps), resistors (ion channels), and capacitors (membrane)
