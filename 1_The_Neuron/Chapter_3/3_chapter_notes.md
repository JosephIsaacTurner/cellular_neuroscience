## Chapter 3: Introduction to Ion Channels

**1. Basic properties of ion channels**
- **Permeability:** How easily ions can pass through the channel in a biological membrane (usually very permeable)
- **Specificity:** How selective the channel is for a particular ion
- **Gating:** What causes the channel to open or close

**2 Selectivity Filter:** Narrowest region of channel that determines which ions can pass through
- **Hydration sphere:** The water molecules that surround an ion in solution. Selectivity filter is able to strip away the hydration sphere of the ion, allowing it to pass through the channel.
- **Chemical interactions:** The selectivity filter has amino acids that interact with the ion, determining which ions can pass through. 
- **Diameter:** The selectivity filter is very narrow, so only ions of a certain size can pass through.

**3. Patch clamp technique:** Technique used to study ion channels
- Glass micropipette isolates patch of membrane
- Current passing through ion channel is measured
- **Whole-cell**: Suction applied to micropipette ruptures membrane, allowing entire cell to be recorded
- **Single-channel:** Only one ion channel is recorded

**4. IV Plots:** Plots of voltage vs current
- At different voltages, current is measured to determine how the channel responds to voltage
- Ohmic channels are linear, meaning that current is proportional to voltage
- Rectifying channels are nonlinear
- Slope = conductance (g) = 1/resistance

**5. Channel gating methods**
- Local conformational changes close off pore
- General structural changes open/close entire channel
- Blocking particle interrupts pore
- **Stimuli:**
    - Ligand-gated: Ligand binds to channel
    - Voltage-gated: Voltage changes across membrane
    - Phosphorylation-gated: Phosphorylation of channel
    - Mechanically-gated: Mechanical force on channel, such as stretch/pressure

**6. Pharmacology of ion channels**
- Agonists: Will open the channel
    - Endogenous: naturally produced by body
    - Exogenous: artificially produced
- Antagonists: Will close the channel
    - Reversible: Can be removed
    - Irreversible: Cannot be removed
- **ACh receptors regulators**
    - Nicotine: Exogenous agonist
    - Curare: Exogenous antagonist
    - alpha-bungarotoxin: Exogenous antagonist (irreversible)

**7. Pentameric Ligand-Gated Channel Family**
- **Structure:** 5 subunits, each with 4 transmembrane domains (20 total transmembrane domains per channel).
    - M1, M2, M3, M4: Transmembrane domains that form the pore
    - M2: Selectivity filter, will have negatively charged residues to attract cations (or vice-versa)
    - N-terminal binds ligands
- **Examples:**
    - nAChR
    - 5-HT3
    - GABAa
    - Glycine

**8. Voltage-Gated Channels**
- **Structure:**
    - Na+ channels have 4 connected domains
    - K+ channels have 4 distinct subunits, but similar structure to Na+ domains
    - 6 transmembrane domains (S1-S6) per subunit
    - S4: Voltage sensor
        - Positively charged such that hyperpolarized membrane potential pulls it downward, closing the channel; depolarized membrane potential swings it upward, opening the channel
    - S5, S6: Pore loop domain
    - N terminal and C-terminal are intracellular
- **Pharmacology:**
    - Tetrodotoxin (TTX): Blocks Na+ channels
    - Tetraethylammonium (TEA): Blocks K+ channels
- **Channelopathy:** Genetic mutation in ion channel that causes disease
